## Hi, I'm Dai Luu 👋
Full-stack developer (Ruby on Rails MVC)
With strong Ruby on Rail and database skills, I helped customer to build reliable and scalable web application.
I can also code reactjs and perform pretty well with html, css and javascript.
Here's some of my achievements:
- Implemented a complex algorithm to help customer automate their work reduce the time it took to complete their task from 20 - 30 minutes to just 2 - 5 minutes. Enhance the algorithm and fine-tune the code so the time it take for an api call meet the requirement 30 seconds to 1 minutes.
- Integrated In app purchase (Apple and Android) to help customer with their payment function in their mobile app. Gain trust and good feedback from customers, they introduce me to another 3 projects to implement the same function. <br />

- Speed up multiple apis by fixing slow queries. Checking and indexing the sql base on the sql execution plan, adding code to detecting the N+1 problem while run unit test (so it can be checked in CI). <br />
